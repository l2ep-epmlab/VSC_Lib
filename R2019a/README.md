# Grid Forming Models for Matlab/SimPowerSystem

## Introduction
After the european project [Migrate](https://www.h2020-migrate.eu), generic simulation models for grid forming converters has been developped.

The package in this repository are a set of Grid-Forming and Grid-Following inverter models for Matlab/SimpowerSystem. It is designed as an easy-to-use and modifiable simulation library for researchers, engineers, teachers, and students.

## Terms of use
The package is distributed as MIT license
While not required by the terms of the license, we do request that publications derived from the use of the models explicitly cite the following references:

## Getting started
### Requirements
* Matlab (>R2015a)
* Simulink (>R2015a)
* Simscape electrical Specialized Technology (>R2015a)

### Installation
1. Download the library from this repositery
> or
1. Clone this repositery
2. Choose your release
3. type the following command from the folder where you have extracted the library.
```shell
setup_VSC_Lib
```
> or
3. add the Library folder in your Matlab path and refresh your simulink library browser
4. Check that a new library named 'VSC4SPS' has been added in the library browser of Simulink

### Examples
Some examples are available in the folders "Examples" for different Matlab releases
These folders include some basics files and the simulation used inside the first cited paper: Promises and Challenges of Grid Forming: Transmission System Operator, Manufacturer and Academic View Points.
